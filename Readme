# Controlling Games with Joystick Module using Arduino Leonardo


Enhance your gaming experience by controlling games using a joystick module and Arduino Leonardo! üéÆüïπÔ∏è

## Project Overview

This repository contains all the necessary code and resources to build a setup that allows you to control games using a joystick module connected to an Arduino Leonardo board. With this project, you can translate physical joystick movements into in-game actions, adding a new layer of interactivity to your favorite games.

## Features

- **Precision Control:** The joystick module provides accurate and smooth control over game actions, giving you a competitive edge.
- **Versatility:** The setup can be adapted for various types of games, from racing simulators to role-playing games.
- **Customizability:** You can customize the Arduino code to map joystick movements to specific keyboard keys or mouse actions according to your preferences.
- **DIY Learning:** This project is an excellent way to learn about Arduino programming, electronics, and hands-on prototyping.

## Components Used

- Arduino Leonardo Board
- Joystick Module
- Jumper Wires


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arduino-joystick-gaming.git`.

2. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the joystick module to the Arduino Leonardo board as described in the [hardware-setup.md](docs/hardware-setup.md) guide.

3. **Upload Code:** Upload the provided Arduino sketch (`joystick_1.ino`) to your Arduino Leonardo using the Arduino IDE. This code reads joystick input and sends corresponding commands to the computer.

4. **Customization:** Modify the Arduino code to suit your gaming needs. Map joystick movements to specific keys or mouse actions based on the games you play.

5. **Enjoy Gaming:** Launch your favorite games and experience a new way of playing by using the joystick module.

## Documentation

For detailed instructions on hardware setup, Arduino code explanation, and customization, refer to the [documentation](docs/README.md) provided in the `docs` directory.

## Future Enhancements

This project opens the door to endless possibilities. Some future enhancements you could consider:

- Integrating the joystick with virtual reality setups for immersive gameplay.
- Expanding the setup to control drones or robotic systems in simulated environments.
